# Clustering Algorithm

#### K-prototype Algorithm

* K-menas algorithm is an classic clustering algorithm, but only support numerical variables
* K-prototype algorithm is an extendation of K-means method, which allows for categorical variables
  refer to: [Extensions to the k-Means Algorithm for Clustering Large Data Sets with Categorical Values.pdf](https://github.com/AiDatawxy/ClusterAlgorithm/blob/master/Extensions%20to%20the%20k-Means%20Algorithm%20for%20Clustering%20Large%20Data%20Sets%20with%20Categorical%20Values.pdf)
  
* [k_prototype.py](https://github.com/AiDatawxy/ClusterAlgorithm/blob/master/k_prototype.py) is a simple implementaion of K-prototype algorithm using Python based on data shape of DataFrame
